# To ensure security and compatibility, regularly update the NODE_VERSION ARG to the latest LTS version.

# by adding: --mount=type=cache,target=/app/.next/cache
# This caches the .next/cache directory across builds, but it also prevents
# .next/cache/fetch-cache from being included in the final image, meaning
# cached fetch responses from the build won't be available at runtime.
